README

This game is loosely based off of the pinball game from old Windows machines. To change the strength of a shot, hit the down arrow key to make it stronger and hit the up arrow key to make it a lighter shot. Once a strength is chosen, hit the enter key to shoot the ball. Score is achieved and displayed by hitting the little targets on the board. When a ball is out of play, the player loses a life and gets to shoot another ball (3 lives total). 

================================================

The message below was sent to you on discord the night the project was due. I (Joe) just wanted to make sure that there are multiple locations where you are aware of this. There was a lot of last minute cramming trying to make up for what needed to be done. Also the lack of a partner made it difficult to catch up. Nothing personally against Kelsey, we (Jose and I) thought it should be brought up however. 

"Hey Dr. Burns, I just wanted to informally let you know that Me and Jose's partner Kelsey is not responding and nothing has been committed to our project by her. I feel bad because she was super nice and responsive. However, we haven't heard from her at all since she left to go to a funeral. I do not know if this is related or not. However, I thought I should at-least let you know because me and Jose are currently taking a method acting approach to being game developers and are currently in crunch mode finishing what isn't here."
